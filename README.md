DRAWING ON THE WEB: OUTLINE OF FINAL PROJECT

For my final project, I have decided to focus on my own artist project, the release of three upcoming singles from an upcoming EP - written, produced and performed by me. I envision to have each drawing be dedicated to each single, outfitted to match the song’s vibe and meaning, and allowing users to listen to the song. Each page will thus have a theme, and I am hoping to represent each with a SVG/canvas/CSS drawing. Each page will also have a level of interactivity, as to keep the user captivated. This might be through the playing of a video or animations controlled by buttons. 

For the first drawing (song: “In The Breeze”), the page will be characterized by the butterfly I previously created using CSS. For the second drawing (song: “Colors”), the page will be inspired by flowers. I hope to create an animated flower using CSS, and have a background drawing made with HTML canvas, as to fittingly have the best access to colors through pixels. For the third drawing (song: “Parti/Partout”), the page will be inspired by the ghosts I previously created using SVG, but I hope to utilize animation. 

I hope to cohesively create these three pages, and I plan on tying them together with the landing page, which will be more representative of the upcoming EP. I plan on keeping this page clean and simple, as to draw focus on the pages and songs.
